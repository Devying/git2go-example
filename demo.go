How many levels of inception we need to master git?

This tutorial that explains how to use git2go to publish an article for the Go Advent 2014.

Git2go implements go bindings for libgit2, a pure C implementation of the Git core methods. This is important because, unlike other libraries, libgit2 doesn¡¯t talk with any git binary.

You won¡¯t find the installation complicated if you¡¯ve worked already with other C libraries. I recommend you to read the installation section in the readme. There is a detailed list of pre-requisites that you¡¯ll need to install.

The first step to publish our new article is to fetch the project from GitHub. We¡¯re going to clone the repository for that.

import "github.com/libgit2/git2go"

repo, err := git.Clone("git://github.com/gopheracademy/gopheracademy-web.git", "web", &git.CloneOptions{})
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
With web, we¡¯re telling git2go to clone the project in the directory web from our current one.

Now that we have the project downloaded to our machine, let¡¯s create a branch to put our article.

When you create a new branch, Git creates a reference to the commit you¡¯re current on. There is a fantastic explanation about creating branches in Pro Git that explains this concept further. Since we just cloned the repository, we can get the current commit from HEAD. That will give us the latest commit in the master branch. This operation is recorded in the reflog with the signature of the author and a message. Git2go allows you, additionally, to decide if you want to force the creation of the branch or not. I recommend you to always use false to not force the creation and avoid side effects.

import (
	"time"
	"github.com/libgit2/git2go"
)

signature := &git.Signature{
	Name: "David Calavera",
	Email: "david.calavera@gmail.com",
	When: time.Now(),
}

head, err := repo.Head()
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

headCommit, err := repo.LookupCommit(head.Target())
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

branch, err = repo.CreateBranch("git2go-tutorial", headCommit, false, signature, "Branch for git2go's tutorial")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
Once we have the branch created, we need to add our markdown document to the index, sometimes referred as the staging area. This is the same operation you would do using git add file.

import "github.com/libgit2/git2go"

idx, err := repo.Index()
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

err = idx.AddByPath("content/advent-2014/git2go-tutorial.md")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

treeId, err := idx.WriteTree()
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

err = idx.Write()
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
That will put our article in the staging area. The next step is to commit this changes!

To create the commit, we¡¯re going to use some information from the branch we just created. We need the tree that the index is pointing to and my signature as a committer and author.

import "github.com/libgit2/git2go"

tree, err := repo.LookupTree(treeId)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

commitTarget, err := repo.LookupCommit(branch.Target())
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

message := "Add Git2go tutorial"
err = repo.CreateCommit("refs/heads/git2go-tutorial", signature, signature, message, tree, commitTarget)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
With this, we created a new commit. We also pointed the reference refs/heads/git2go-tutorial to it. And used the base commit of the branch as a parent.

Now, it¡¯s time to push our branch to my fork of the project. For this, we¡¯re going to need another remote repository. I have my fork in https://github.com/calavera/gopheracademy-web.

Git2go uses callbacks to feed some processes with intermediate information when it¡¯s needed. In this case, I¡¯ll need to provide two callbacks: one that connects with the ssh agent in my machine to extract my credentials, and a second callback to verify that I¡¯m connecting with Github:

import "github.com/libgit2/git2go"

func credentialsCallback(url string, username string, allowedTypes git.CredType) (int, *git.Cred) {
	ret, cred := git.NewCredSshKeyFromAgent(username)
	return git.ErrorCode(ret), &cred
}

func certificateCheckCallback(cert *git.Certificate, valid bool, hostname string) int {
	if hostname != "github.com" {
		return git.ErrUser
	}
	return 0
}
Now that we have our callbacks, let¡¯s create that new remote and push my new branch.

import "github.com/libgit2/git2go"

fork, err := repo.CreateRemote("calavera", "git@github.com:calavera/gopheracademy-web.git")

cbs := &git.RemoteCallbacks{
	CredentialsCallback: credentialsCallback,
	CertificateCheckCallback: certificateCheckCallback,
}

err = fork.SetCallbacks(cbs)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

push, err := fork.NewPush()
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

err = push.AddRefspec("refs/heads/git2go-tutorial")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

err = push.Finish()
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
And with that, we only need to create a new pull request and wait until this article is published!

PS: I left the complete, working code in this repository. Play with it and use it to send the next article for the Go Advent Series!
